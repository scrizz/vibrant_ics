This is mostly taken from OneCosmics device tree
Currently uses the CM structure as I used that for the base
All files taken from the AOKP Vibrant Port
The Kernel is out dated and may not boot...
The Gps files may or may not work and probably dont because of the kernel


The goal is to make it easy to port AOSP roms to the vibrant and no longer need to do ports from other phones!

I have no clue how much of this will work I hope its atleast a start.

If you edit this device tree please keep it open. I dont want to see people take it fix it and then not let other people use it, Android is open!
